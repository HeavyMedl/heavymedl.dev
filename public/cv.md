## Skills

**Languages:** Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML / CSS, Java, Haskell

**Tools and Frameworks:** Node.js, Git, Ubuntu, Docker, Spring, Vue, Vite, Webpack, React, Astro, $\LaTeX$

## Industry Achievements

A few things I'm proud of. See more <a href="https://heavymedl.dev/cv/#industry-achievements" target="_blank">here</a>.

- **Brought Vite, Vitest, and Vue 3 to REI**: I created a proof of technology that replaced our tools with Vite and Vitest, updated our back-end library to integrate Vite-compiled assets, and rewrote our server-rendering solution for Vue to accommodate Vue 3. This was adopted by all product engineering teams at REI. Read the whole story [here](https://heavymedl.dev/posts/unleashing-the-power-of-vite-and-vitest-at-rei/).
- **Rewrote REI's Adventures property with Vue**: When I joined REI, my team and I rewrote [REI's Adventures](https://www.rei.com/adventures) property with Vue. We decommissioned several overlapping frameworks, ported functional requirements from legacy code, and delivered new user journeys.
- **Wrote middleware to server-render Vue applications at REI**: I wrote an Express.js implementation with TypeScript that is responsible for server-rendering Vue applications in REI's stack. This dockerized server runs adjacent to the primary microsite, handling HTTP requests to render server bundles, and finally sending back the resultant HTML to the primary microsite, where it is ultimately injected into our base templates.
