# Recruiter scripts

## Describe your current role

REI is primarily a Vue.js shop, but we have several React applications.

I'm on a small front-end platform team that's responsible for integrating front-end technologies into our development ecosystem at REI. We build Vue and React applications. We maintain several critical internal apps built with Vue.js.

- One is a template web app used to scaffold new microsites at REI. It contains up-to-date dependencies, UI, and patterns for development.
- One is an NPM package discovery app, similar to npmjs.org, used by developers to check package dependents. Its also used by product managers for reporting on consumers of old versions of software.

Our team is in a larger platform engineering division, and so we work closely with our back-end engineers. Our microsite architecture uses the Spring Framework, so we maintain several Java libraries to facilitate using Vite-compiled bundles.

- I wrote the server-side rendering middleware which is built with Express.js
- Asset injector that injects Vite-compiled bundles into our templates.
- We perform R&D on industry techologies and integrate into our ecosystem.
- We provide support to all of our product engineering teams.
- We use GitLab for CI/CD, so our team also writes the scripts used for building and publishing NPM packages to our internal registry.

Prior to this, I worked for REI's Experiences divison, where I rewrote the REI Adventures property with Vue. This role followed an SDLC using agile methodologies. We'd work with UX designers who'd deliver Figma specifications that we'd build our apps with.

## Working with Erik
