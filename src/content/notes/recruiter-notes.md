# Recruiter scripts

## Describe your current role

### Opener / general detail

I'm a front-end engineer on a platform team that supports all product engineering at REI. We have a micro-service architecture that uses a customization built on Spring Boot. We call our web applications "microsites", and they're built on that architecture. On the front end, we're a Vue.js shop, however, we have several React apps that we build and maintain.

My responsibility on this small team is to work with solution architects to deliver horizontal solutions to our product engineering teams. We work closely with many enablement teams across many domains to deliver a unified platform.

### Finer detail

- Our team builds and maintains several internal Vue applications
  - One is the archetypal microsite that is used as a reference
  - Another is a package discovery tool used by engineers to evaluate metadata. It's also used by product managers for reporting.
- Ensure assets bundled by build tools are consumable by our custom back-end.
  - **Example**: We maintain several Java libraries that facilitate this.
- We write CLI tools for scaffolding new applications:
  - **Example**: Our NPM initializer
- We write GitLab CI scripts for publishing NPM packages to our internal registry.
- Perform R&D on emerging front-end technologies. We vet them and build proof-of-technologies
  - **Example**: brought Vite and Vitest to REI.
- Build tools, plugins, and configurations that are used company-wide.

#### Ecosystem

- We use AWS to deploy our micro-services and sites.
- Akamai is our edge cache layer.
- We use Akamai NetStorage for our CDN

## Last project

- Brought TypeScript to REI: led an initiative to bring TS to REI. Converted all our build tools and applications to TS and helped convert other teams' microsites. Created the direction necessary for teams to follow.
- Brought Vite and Vitest to REI, and helped convert various microsites to Vue 3.

## Proficiencies

- Lots of expertise in front-end technologies
  - JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, Java, Python, Vue, React
- Very familiar and comfortable with large distributed systems and eCommerce.

### Old

REI is primarily a Vue.js shop, but we have several React applications.

I'm on a small front-end platform team that's responsible for integrating front-end technologies into our development ecosystem at REI. We build Vue and React applications. We maintain several critical internal apps built with Vue.js.

- One is a template web app used to scaffold new microsites at REI. It contains up-to-date dependencies, UI, and patterns for development.
- One is an NPM package discovery app, similar to npmjs.org, used by developers to check package dependents. Its also used by product managers for reporting on consumers of old versions of software.

Our team is in a larger platform engineering division, and so we work closely with our back-end engineers. Our microsite architecture uses the Spring Framework, so we maintain several Java libraries to facilitate using Vite-compiled bundles.

- I wrote the server-side rendering middleware which is built with Express.js
- Asset injector that injects Vite-compiled bundles into our templates.
- We perform R&D on industry technologies and integrate them into our ecosystem.
- We provide support to all of our product engineering teams.
- We use GitLab for CI/CD, so our team also writes the scripts used for building and publishing NPM packages to our internal registry.

Before this, I worked for REI's Experiences division, where I rewrote the REI Adventures property with Vue. This role followed an SDLC using agile methodologies. We'd work with UX designers who'd deliver Figma specifications that we'd build our apps with.

## Working with Erik

Erik was a product manager on my team. He brought great energy and expertise. We spent a lot of time working on web performance initiatives together. We'd do web performance audits on our properties. Help instrument horizontal solutions to help improve web performance metrics.

## Why am I looking to leave

- Writing is on the wall for internal IT at REI. Leadership announced a 50% workforce reduction to internal IT in the next 2 years
- Culture has taken a big quality hit in the last 3 years
<!-- - Looking to join a new team with higher floor -->

## Working for Walmart

- Erik has mentioned that the technical acumen is high at walmart.
- I've also heard the development ecosystem is modernized
- Hoping to be around motivated people.

<!-- ## Interested in Amazon AWS?

- Interested in cloud engineering.
- I've built toy projects with EC2 -->
