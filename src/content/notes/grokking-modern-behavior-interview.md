# Grokking Modern Behavior Interview

## The STAR method

STAR stands for Situation, Task, Action, and Result.

### Situation

The first step in the STAR method is to describe the Situation or context of the story you are about to share. This sets the stage for your example, providing the interviewer with essential background information to understand the challenges and constraints you faced. When describing the situation, be concise and focus on relevant details, such as the work environment, team dynamics, project goals, or external factors that influenced the scenario.

Remember to maintain a professional tone and avoid sharing overly personal or confidential information. It's important to strike a balance between providing enough context and not overwhelming the interviewer with too much information.

### Task

Next, you need to outline the Task or objective you were responsible for in the given situation. This component highlights your role and the expectations that were placed upon you. Describe the specific goals, deadlines, or deliverables that you were working towards, and explain why they were important to the team or organization.

When discussing the task, emphasize the challenges you encountered and any obstacles that made it particularly difficult or complex. This will help the interviewer understand the level of responsibility you had and the skills required to successfully complete the task.

### Action

The Action component is arguably the most crucial part of the STAR method, as it showcases the specific steps you took to address the situation and accomplish the task. Here, you should describe the actions you took, the thought process behind your decisions, and any strategies or techniques you employed to overcome the challenges you faced.

Focus on your contributions and be clear about your role in the situation, but avoid taking credit for the work of others or downplaying the efforts of your team members. The interviewer wants to understand your individual capabilities and how you collaborate with others to achieve results.

### Result

Finally, the Result component allows you to share the outcome of your actions and demonstrate the impact of your work. Describe the positive outcomes that resulted from your efforts, such as successful project completion, improved efficiency, cost savings, or enhanced team dynamics. If possible, quantify your results with specific numbers or percentages to give the interviewer a clear sense of the scale of your achievements.

In addition to the immediate results, discuss any lessons you learned or skills you developed through the experience. This demonstrates your ability to reflect on your experiences and grow professionally.

Now that we have a clear understanding of the STAR method let's walk through a concrete example to see how it can be applied in a real-life interview scenario.

Imagine you are being interviewed for a software engineer position, and the interviewer asks, "Tell me about a time when you had to manage a project with tight deadlines and limited resources."

### Example

Using the STAR method, you could structure your response as follows:

**Situation**: "A few months ago, I was working as a software engineer on a team that was responsible for maintaining and updating a large e-commerce platform. One day, we started receiving reports from users that the checkout process was occasionally failing, preventing them from completing their purchases. The issue was intermittent and difficult to reproduce, making it a particularly challenging problem to diagnose and resolve."

**Task**: "As a software engineer on the team, my task was to identify the root cause of the issue and implement a solution as quickly as possible to minimize the impact on our users and the company's revenue. We needed to ensure the stability and reliability of the platform while maintaining a positive user experience."

**Action**: "To tackle this issue, I first analyzed the error logs and user reports to gather as much information as possible about the circumstances surrounding the failures. I then set up a testing environment that mimicked the production system, allowing me to reproduce the issue without affecting real users.

Once I was able to consistently reproduce the problem, I used a combination of debugging tools and techniques to methodically narrow down the potential causes. I isolated specific parts of the codebase, examined the data flow, and monitored the system's behavior under different conditions.

After extensive testing and analysis, I identified the root cause as a race condition in our database transactions, which occurred only under specific circumstances when two users attempted to check out at the same time. To resolve this issue, I implemented a locking mechanism to ensure that the transactions were processed sequentially, eliminating the race condition and preventing the checkout failures.

Before deploying the fix to the production environment, I thoroughly tested the solution in our staging environment to ensure that it resolved the issue without introducing any new problems or affecting the platform's performance."

**Result**: "After deploying the fix, the checkout failures were eliminated, and we received no further reports of issues from our users. This not only improved the user experience but also protected the company's revenue by ensuring a reliable and stable checkout process.

As a result of this experience, I gained a deeper understanding of the importance of thorough debugging and testing, as well as the value of having a robust testing environment in place. I also honed my problem-solving skills and learned new debugging techniques that have proven invaluable in my work as a software engineer."

In this example, the STAR method is used effectively to answer the behavioral interview question by providing a clear and structured response that highlights the candidate's problem-solving abilities, technical expertise, and attention to detail as a software engineer

#### Full script

I was a full-stack engineer for Costco building web applications. Costco uses mostly IBM (now HCL) products for their eCommerce. That includes WebSphere eCommerce, the back-end application server, DB2, the relational database, IBM MQ, IBM CMC for the content management system, and Sterling OMS for order processing. We used Azure for deployment and scaling.

I started gravitating toward front-end development after leading a responsive redesign project that brought Bootstrap and Webpack to Costco. I built many customer-facing pages including the warehouse locator, the header and footer, the product page, the check-out flow, and the search page. We integrated lots of 3rd party vendors like Rich Relevance, Bazaar Voice, and Adobe Analytics.

Toward the end of my career with Costco, I introduced React to their front end.

I began my time with REI on their Adventures property, where I converted it to Vue.js, which was the framework they landed on, which was driven by experimentation with their design system team.

Shortly after the pandemic, Adventures was temporarily displaced. Given my full-stack experience, I was moved to a platform team specialized in front-end engineering. This team collaborates with the broader enablement teams. My responsibility on this team is to work with solution architects to deliver horizontal solutions to our product engineering teams, based on their needs.

### Why Walmart / this role / why leave your current role?

I appreciate my time with REI. I've learned a lot about front-end engineering on multiple teams. As a specialty retailer, REI has struggled financially post-pandemic. As such, I do think the engineering career path has stagnated. There's a shortage of opportunity.

I've been an admirer of Walmart in the eCommerce space since I worked at Costco. They are progressive and bold. They were ahead of the curve converting Walmart.com to React and Node.js back in 2016. The experience online is fantastic.

Being an open-source contributor, I like that Walmart contributes to the open-source community with its various projects under WalmartLabs.

I think my experience and unique set of skills would be valuable to Walmart's MarTech team.

- I regularly integrate 1st and 3rd party marketing technology into templates.
- I have strong proficiency with many different front-end technologies.
- I have a proclivity for simplifying complex systems.
- I'm excited by the idea of working on a different kind of platform like My Local Social and the prospect of contributing to a great experience for store associates.

### Questions for Walmart

1. I'm about the portfolio of applications that I'd be working on. What sort of technology stack does MLS use? Inspiration hub?
2. Are there opportunities to contribute to open-source projects or participate in community events sponsored by the company?
3. Can you discuss the team culture and how the company promotes collaboration and teamwork?

## Collaboration and teamwork questions

### Can you provide an example of when you had to work with a difficult team member? How did you handle that situation?

#### Example 1

Disagreement with a solution architect at Costco around how a particular feature would be engineered.

**Situation**/**Task**: I was a lead on a project that introduced Gas Prices to the Costco warehouse locator. The solution architect assigned to the project was spread thin across multiple projects.

**Action**: My engineering team and I ended up designing an architecture that was greenlit by another architect in the same space, as ours was too swamped to participate in the planning stages of our solution. A week before our launch date, our assigned architect reviewed our solution and decided it should be refactored, even though the solution had been approved by his colleague. I explained to him that his suggestions, while valid, would endanger the timeline of the project.

**Result**: Understanding the urgency of the feature's timeline, the architect agreed that we should revisit the solution at another time. We went forward with our architecture, and it was never revisited.

#### Example 2

Working with a bespoke engineer on the Front-end Platform team at REI. TODO

### Describe a situation where you had to resolve a conflict between team members. How did you handle it, and what was the result?

#### Example 1

Disagreement with an approach for resolving dynamic components with Nuxt.

**Situation**: Our architect had been exploring a way to drive a configuration-driven page with Vue. After attending VueConf, he created a proof-of-technology that leveraged the Nuxt framework. The implication was that it would replace our tooling. An engineer on our team was combative with the architect, arguing that the same features could be implemented with our existing tools.

**Action**: I organized a meeting with the architect and engineer. I acted as a mediator between them. We discussed the ultimate goals of architects' solution.

**Result**: It was determined that there was a misunderstanding of the architect's ultimate goal. Instead of replacing our toolset with Nuxt, we decided to create a discovery task for resolving Vue components with a configuration.

### Tell me about a time when you had to work with a remote team or under a remote work setup. How did you ensure effective communication and collaboration?

#### Example 1

After the pandemic, REI sold its HQ campuses, and those employees went fully remote. To adjust to this, our teams set up weekly collaborative work sessions on Microsoft Teams, continued our agile ceremonies virtually and communicated on Slack regularly. Many of us feel as though our productivity is better in a remote setting.

#### Example 2

While at Costco, for several projects, I had to lead a team of offshore contractors out of Belgrade, Serbia. To ensure we collaborated effectively, I set up virtual status meetings in the early mornings, which aligned with the end of the working day in Serbia. Doing this allowed me to communicate up-to-date project progress to stakeholders.

### Why do you want to quit your current job?

#### Example 1

While I appreciate the opportunities REI has afforded me, the engineering path has become stagnant. I'm an admirer of Walmart's eCommerce platform and its contribution to open-source software via WalmartLabs. When I worked at Costco, I knew Walmart was moving to Node.js and React, which influenced our decision to adopt React. Being part of this type of energy is exciting to me, and I feel as though I could excel in this ecosystem.

## Adaptability questions

### Can you describe a time when you had to learn a new programming language or technology quickly? How did you go about it?

#### Example 1

Learning new technologies and programming languages is a way of life for me. When I joined REI, I had a strong foundation using vanilla JavaScript and jQuery for DOM manipulation. I had just started building applications with React. REI was a Vue shop, so I had to quickly learn how to use Vue and be proficient with it. I took on some at-home projects building eCommerce-focused pages with Vue until I felt like I had mastered most of the framework's features.

### Tell me about a time when you had to adapt to a significant change in your work environment or project scope. How did you handle it?

#### Example 1

This tends to happen often. And project scope can be altered by any constituent involved in a particular project. I was once tasked with leading a "membership validation" project at Costco where the goal was to create a user journey that prompted questions to the customer to validate their membership for specific flows. Close to launch, my director wanted to ensure the user journey was behind a feature flag, which was not accounted for. I went back to my team to reevaluate the project plan. To account for this feature flag, we had to adjust our timeline to accommodate the new requirements. We completed the project successfully on the adjusted timeline.

## Communication skills questions

### How do you handle receiving constructive criticism from your peers or supervisors? Can you provide an example?

#### Example 1

Constructive criticism is an essential part of personal and professional growth. When I receive it, I'm grateful. I appreciate the opportunity to improve myself as a human and engineer. When I don't receive it, I'm disappointed.

During a presentation to engineers where I was explaining our adoption of Vite and Vitest, I received feedback my presentations were too technically dense. I decided to build some visualizations of the underlying technologies and their relation to our ecosystem. This forced me to think of the relation of everything at a higher level. I gave a presentation to a broader group using my visualizations as a guide. I got positive feedback on this presentation, and it helped solidify my understanding.

### Can you share an experience where you had to adapt your communication style when explaining technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders?

See above example

### What is the most critical feedback you've received from your boss in your entire career?

#### Example 1

Early in my career, my manager suggested that I express my ideas to the team more often. I found that it could be difficult to share ideas in corporate settings for fear of rejection. I started writing out my ideas on lists to help flesh them out before presenting them. The act of writing ideas down is now commonplace for me. Between this and practice, I no longer fear sharing ideas. I put my ego aside.

## Problem-solving and decision-making questions

### How do you approach problem-solving and debugging when faced with a complex issue in your code?

#### Example 1

When I'm faced with a complex issue in code, I start by analyzing the issue at a high level. Sometimes doing this can give me clues that will help me at a lower level. I review code and always try to reproduce an issue in a lower environment. I use debugging tools and log analysis to gather more information about the problem.

A customer was experiencing a generic error related to checking out on Costco.com. I first attempted to reproduce the error in our QA environment but was unsuccessful. I used a tool called DynaTrace to map the user's IP to flow through the user's journey to checking out. By isolating the customer's request flow, I determined the path (purchasing tires) that led to the generic error. This allowed me to isolate the issue and find the problem in the code.

An engineer using one of our configuration dependencies was having an issue running unit tests with Vitest. She was experiencing an unrecognized error in her terminal. I checked out her project. I built the project and ran her test suites. I was able to reproduce the error. I traced it back to a special character defined in the name of her project.

### How do you handle situations where you are unsure of how to proceed or solve a problem? Can you provide an example?

#### Example 1

Initially, I always try to solve a problem myself. If I find myself at an impasse, I'm not afraid to reach out for guidance. Sometimes that means reaching out to my direct team members. Sometimes that means reaching out to cross-functional teams. For example, we wrote a custom Thymeleaf dialect to handle injecting assets from a micro-service. There was an issue where the dialect would intermittently fail to resolve. I reached out to our platform engineering team to discover that a new caching configuration was preventing the service call in some cases.

## Time management and prioritization questions

### How do you manage your workload and prioritize tasks when working on multiple projects simultaneously?

#### Example 1

If I do have overlapping priorities, I always communicate that to stakeholders. I generally prioritize a task by urgency. I use project management tools to manage and prioritize tasks. I'll use visualizations in these tools to help me get a clear picture of what's on my plate.

### Describe a situation where you had to meet a tight deadline on a project. How did you ensure the project was completed on time and met quality standards?

#### Example 1

When re-engineering REI's Adventures property to Vue.js, I was given 3 quarters to not only decommission overlapping frameworks and implement Vue.js but also build brand new experiences for most of the pages. I used project management tools to analyze the tasks and estimate the time required. I then prioritized the tasks that were critical for project success. We prioritized the most meaningful pages including the Trip Details page and the checkout flow. Using these tools with regular check-ins with my team, we were able to deliver a new REI Adventures on Vue.

## Initiative and leadership questions

### Tell me about a time when you took the initiative to improve a process or implement a new idea within your team.

#### Example 1

Wrote a GitLab CI/CD script for pre-release versions

#### Example 2 and 3

- Brought Vite and Vitest to REI. Dispensed with old wrapper abstractions.
- Brought Webpack to Costco

### Tell me about a time when you mentored or helped train a junior team member. What was your approach, and what did you learn from the experience?

#### Example 1

Mentored interns at Costco. Set up a React project for them to work toward and had them present that project at the end of the project.

## Technical competence and quality questions

### Can you share an example of a time when you had to deal with a particularly tricky software issue? What steps did you take to resolve it?

REI product-page memory leak

### What is your approach to balancing the need for high-quality code with the need to deliver features quickly in a fast-paced environment?

#### Example 1

Iterate! Deliver high-quality features that are resilient (unit tests). Deliver the most urgent flows and come back later.

## Managing constraints and setbacks questions

### Tell me about a time when you had to push back on a request or feature due to technical constraints. How did you communicate your concerns, and what was the outcome?

#### Example 1

Nuxt -> We didn't have the infrastructure to quickly switch to Nuxt. Our backend was Spring, and all the tools and support resources were Java-based. I had to push back on the solutions architect and explain why it this wasn't a quick switch for a feature he wanted.

### Describe a project where you encountered significant setbacks or obstacles. How did you stay motivated and focused on achieving the project goals?

#### Example 1

When I was looking at upgrading our stack to use Vue 3, I consistently ran into obstacles that prevented me from making progress. At the time we used some dated technologies that were wrapped by our custom build tools. I tried hacking a solution using our build tools but continually failed because of outdated interdependent packages. I was motivated by my knowledge that this was achievable with a major overhaul. Finally, I landed on replacing our tools entirely, which ultimately led to REI's upgrade to Vue 3.
