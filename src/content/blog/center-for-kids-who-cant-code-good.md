Like many, I struggle with procrastination and information overload. These frequently inhibit my ability to complete extracurricular goals.

To help combat that this year, I decided to start a community Discord server that would serve as a persistent resource on my journey to become a better software engineer.

In this community, we practice kata in the form of coding problems. We examine and think critically about data structures and algorithms. We draw squares and connect them with arrows to explain system design and software architecture.

The community's superpower is its structure and pacing. We're not picking and solving random LeetCode problems; we follow existing curricula from giants in the online learning space. This provides structure and a linear sequence of topics that can be digested slowly.

The goal is deep learning through the slow digestion of complex topics. While cramming for coding interviews has merit, ultimately, you get a deeper, more second-nature understanding of a topic through contemplation, the discipline of repeated practice, and positive reinforcement over longer periods.

If you're interested, you're invited. All levels of experience and languages are welcome.

Join me at [HeavyMedl's Center for Kids Who Can't Code Good (and wanna learn to do other stuff good, too)](https://discord.gg/ueCbrwSKVX).
